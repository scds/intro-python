For this workshop, you will need access to a Python interpreter. We provide 3 tools below, you may use whatever works for you best.

## 1. Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook is a web-based Python interpreter. This will be what we are going to use in the workshop. McMaster members should have automatic access to this tool. If you don't have access to Jupyter Notebook, two other alternatives are provided below.
- Simply navigate to <https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/> and sign in with your McMaster account.

## 2. Google Colab
- If Jupyter Notebook didn't work out for you, Google Colab is a wonderful web-based alternative. 
- Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and sign in with your Google account.

## 3. Anaconda
- If you'd rather have a local installation of Python, you can use Anaconda. Anaconda is a distribution of Python built for data science. It comes included with useful data science packages.
- Download and install https://www.anaconda.com/.
- Follow along with the guide for your OS system for installation instructions.
