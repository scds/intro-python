# Lesson 3a - Numbers 

Python has several "types" of data. We've worked with numbers a lot already, but there are also booleans, strings, and containers. 

In this lesson, we'll be working further with numbers. Python separates numbers into three categories: integers, floats, and complex numbers.

## Integers

To see what type of data a variable is holding, we can use the type() function.

<demonstrate type with myVariable>

Integers in Python, unlike other programming languages, don't have a size limit. If you give Python enough memory resources, you could have 1000â€¦ with a million zeroes if you desired.

As we mentioned in a previous lesson, we can use math operations on integers. Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), and floor division (//). 

Note: Division, regardless of whether it produces an integer value, turns the output into a float value. <demonstration>

We can also use comparison operators to compare the value of two expressions.

The six comparison operators are:

Less than	<
Less than or equal	<=
Greater than	>
Greater than or equal	>=
Equality	==
Inequality	!=
