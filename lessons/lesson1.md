## Math Operations

Using Python as a calculator works exactly as you think it does.

*showcase addition input output*

By default, Python supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), and floored division (//). If there are multiple operations in the same line, it follows the typical order of operations.

Parentheses ()
Exponents (**)
Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus (left to right)
Addition and Subtraction

*showcase order of operations input output*

Although we've only been using integers for our math, Python fully supports decimal numbers, as well as complex numbers. We'll briefly talk about complex numbers later in Lesson (whatever)

*showcase math with decimals*
